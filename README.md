## Functional Programming in Scala
* [Introduction](https://github.com/satishThakur/functional-programming/blob/main/docs/basics/intro.md)

### Objectives
This repository contains Functional Programming notes/learning and code examples in my journey to learn functional programming. We would use [typelevel](https://typelevel.org/) ecosystem specifically:
* [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/index.html) - A library which provides abstraction for ***Functional Programming*** in Scala. Cats library implements multiple TypeClasses and instances such as Monoid, functor, Monad, Applicative etc. It also implements multiple data types and structures.
* [Cats-effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) - Library which provides implementation of IO Monad and provides building blocks to write concurrent, parallel and scalable applications. 

### Assumptions
As this repository and code would be in Scala working knowledge of Scala is assumed.

### Core Concepts
* [Contextual Abstraction]
* [Higher Kinded Types](https://github.com/satishThakur/functional-programming/blob/main/docs/HKT.md)
* [Type Classes](https://github.com/satishThakur/functional-programming/blob/main/docs/TypeClasses.md)
* [Tagless Final](https://github.com/satishThakur/functional-programming/blob/main/docs/tagless-encoding/notes.md)

### Cats
Important TypeClasses:
* [Monoid]
* [Functor]
* [Monad]
* [Applicative]
* [Traverse]
* [MonadError & ApplicativeError](https://github.com/satishThakur/functional-programming/blob/main/docs/cats/MonadError.md)
* [MonadTransformer]
* [Kleisli]

### Cats-effect
* [IO Monad]
* [Resource]
* [Supervisor]
* [Fiber]
* [Ref and Defer]
* [TypeClasses]

### Sample Application
