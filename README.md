## Functional Programming in Scala

### Objectives
This repository contains Functional Programming notes/learning and code examples in my journey to learn functional programming. We would use [typelevel](https://typelevel.org/) ecosystem specifically:
* [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/index.html) - A library which provides abstraction for ***Functional Programming*** in Scala. Cats library implements multiple TypeClasses and instances such as Monoid, functor, Monad, Applicative etc. It also implements multiple data types and structures.
* [Cats-effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) - Library which provides implementation of IO Monad and provides building blocks to write concurrent, parallel and scalable applications. 

### Assumptions
As this repository and code would be in Scala working knowledge of Scala is assumed.

### Core Concepts
* [Contextual Abstraction]
* [Higher Kinded Types](https://github.com/satishThakur/functional-programming/blob/main/docs/HKT.md)
* [Type Classes](https://github.com/satishThakur/functional-programming/blob/main/docs/TypeClasses.md)
